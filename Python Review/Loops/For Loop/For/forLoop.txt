For Loops


Iterable object is some kind of collection of items, for instance: a list of numbers, a string of characters, a range, etc.
    item is a new variable that can be called whatever you want 
    itme references the current position of our iterator within the iterable. It will iterate over (run through) every item of the 
    collection and then go away when it has visited all items. 

For loops within ranges 
    Let's print numbers 1 - 7 using our knowledge of looping thru ranges.
