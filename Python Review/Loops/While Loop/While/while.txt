While Loops:
    We can use while loop to loop a boolean expression. While loops continue to execute while a certain condition is truthy, and will
    end when they become falsy. while loops require more careful setup than for loops, since you have to specify the termination conditions
    manually. Be carefu! If the condition doesn't become false at some point, your loop will continue forever

In the while.py example we use a while loop to check if a password is correct and in lines 2 - 6 it will check to see if the user input
    = bananas. The next example uses a while loop to show how it can be used other than the for loop. We use a for loop in lines 9 - 10 and
    show the equivalent of it as a while loop in lines 13 - 16.
